    \n\nI love solving riddles so here\'s one for you:
    \nMany years ago, a wealthy old man was near death. He wished to leave his fortune to one of his
    three children. Te old man wanted to know that his fortune would be in wise hands. He stipulated
    that his estate would be left to the child who would sing him half as many songs as days that he
    had left to live. The eldest son said that he couldn\'t comply because he didn\'t know how many
    days his father had left to live, and besides he was too busy. The youngest son said the same thing.
        The man ended up leaving his money to his third child, a daughter. \nWhat did his daughter do?\n\n
